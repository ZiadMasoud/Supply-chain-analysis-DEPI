## Phases and Deliverables

### Week 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
**Tasks:**
- Import the CSV file into a MySQL database.
- Clean and preprocess the data using Python (handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types).
- Save the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.

**Deliverables:**
- `cleaned_supply_chain_data.csv`
- Python notebook documenting the preprocessing steps.

**Tools:**
- Google Colab, MySQL Workbench, pandas, matplotlib.

### Week 2: Analysis Questions Phase
**Tasks:**
- Determine key business questions to analyze (e.g., the impact of product category on revenue, which supplier contributes the most to profit margins).
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Deliverables:**
- Python notebook documenting EDA and results.
- A list of analysis questions relevant to decision-makers.

**Tools:**
- Google Colab, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

### Week 3: Forecasting Questions Phase
**Tasks:**
- Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Build forecasting models to answer questions such as:
  - What is the expected revenue for the next quarter?
  - Which products are likely to experience demand growth?

**Deliverables:**
- Python notebook with forecasting models and visualizations.

**Tools:**
- Google Colab, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

### Week 4: Visualization Dashboard and Final Presentation
**Tasks:**
- Create an interactive dashboard to showcase key insights.
- Prepare a final report summarizing data cleaning, analysis, forecasting results, and business recommendations.

**Deliverables:**
- Tableau dashboard file.
- Final report and presentation.

**Tools:**
- Tableau Public, Google Colab, pandas, matplotlib.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Colab** for Python scripting.
- **MySQL Workbench** for database management.
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib.

## Installation and Setup
